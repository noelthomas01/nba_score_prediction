# nba_score_prediction
Predicting the points of an nba player based on other factors.
this was done as part of an internship task. 
I used multi-variate linear regression to predict the points scored by nba players in the year 2013 based on some other factors. 
I found the information gain of each column(based on the pearson's coeff) and selected those columns as the said^ factors.
